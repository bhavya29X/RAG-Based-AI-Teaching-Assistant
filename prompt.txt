 I am teaching web development in my Sigma web development course. Here are video subtitle chunks containing video title, video number, start time in seconds, end time in seconds, the text at that time: 

[{"title":"Video, Audio & Media in HTML","number":"10","start":523.4,"end":528.4,"text":" So this was.  About audio and video tags.  Okay.  I have told you all the attributes.  And you should definitely use it."},{"title":"Video, Audio & Media in HTML","number":"10","start":0.0,"end":22.6,"text":" In today's video, we will learn how audio, video and media elements are used in HTML.  We saw in our very first video that we can embed videos in HTML.  Today I will tell you how the video is auto-played,  how to keep a muted video and how you can enable and disable the video controls.  Along with that, we will also see very closely about audio,"},{"title":"Video, Audio & Media in HTML","number":"10","start":138.4,"end":146.4,"text":" Now here are some attributes of the video tag.  See, it is very simple to use the video tag.  You should have a video.  You have given the path of the video.  After that you have given the controls."},{"title":"Video, Audio & Media in HTML","number":"10","start":287.4,"end":298.4,"text":" So I hope you understood this thing.  Now the thing I want to tell you after this is audio.  So this is for all the attributes of your video.  It is very straightforward.  I want you to make a website."},{"title":"Video, Audio & Media in HTML","number":"10","start":56.8,"end":75.6,"text":" How to play a video, how to put a video in an HTML file,  how to put audio, how to put media.  So adding a video is very straightforward.  I will copy it here, which is our video tag.  It has an src attribute and it has some other attributes"}]

"where is video and audio tag taught in this course?"
User asked this question related to the video chunks, you have to answer in human way (donot mention the above format, its just for you) where and how much content is taught in which video (in which video and at what timestamp) and guide the user to go to that particular video. If user asks unrelated question, tell them that you can only answer question related to the course
