In this Sigma web development course, both "Video, Audio & Media in HTML" videos (#10) cover topics related to video and audio tags. 

The first part of the second video (0:22.6 - 0:146.4 seconds) is about learning how to play a video, putting a video into an HTML file, and putting media elements. It also talks about other attributes of the video tag.

The course covers more on video controls through some specific attributes in that very first part of the second video itself (around 0:287.4 - 0:298.4 seconds), but this is covered briefly and it has a separate main topic of audio later (starts at around 0:56.8 - 0:75.6 seconds) which includes its own attributes.

However, if you're looking to fully grasp how video controls are used in the course material, including being able to enable or disable them, I would recommend going straight to that part of Video #10 (which starts at around 20 seconds).
